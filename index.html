    <h2>Checking in on Running Backs Through Week 4</h2>
<br>
  <p>I am back and ready to write. I hope these little recaps enhance your fantasy football experience even 1%; I certainly have fun writing them. Through Week 4, as always, there have been surprises and disappointments. I wanted to focus on running backs this week, the greatest commodities available or unavailable (in many cases) to us in this league.</p>

<p>Derrick Henry (RB1 this season) may be made of metal. Nothing seems to slow him down, as he handled 33 rushing attempts the week the Titans were missing A.J. Brown and Julio Jones. As top RB draft picks are dropping like flies, El Tractorito keeps on trucking for Beginner‚Äôs Luck (6-2). BL also rosters D‚ÄôAndre Swift (RB9), who has produced even while splitting touches with Jamaal Williams (RB21).</p>

<p>Going Allen (1-7) was bold enough to select a potentially injured Austin Ekeler (RB2) in the first round and it has paid off big time. However, Myles Gaskin (RB43) in the third round has to be one of the biggest busts of the year as he has recorded 10 or fewer carries three times, including a measly three yards on two totes in Week 4.</p>

<p>After a slow start to the season, Zach vs. the World (5-3) has capitalized on his Week 3 FAB acquisition Cordarrelle Patterson (RB3!). Patterson doesn‚Äôt get a ton of carries, but is very active as a pass catcher for the Falcons. He also seems to have a huge gain or score a touchdown every time he touches the ball much to the chagrin of Mike Davis‚Äôs (RB28) manager, Mixon it Up! (4-4). James Robinson (RB10) has shown his 2020 form in recent weeks (with better usage, of course).</p>

<p>Mixon it Up!‚Äôs Aaron Jones‚Äôs (RB4) 4-TD game in Week 2 inflates his stock as he‚Äôs had two good games and two bad games. Joe Mixon (RB14), the volume king (non-Henry division), has seen his attempts drop each week and now may be limited by an ankle injury.</p>

<p>For all the discussion about him losing a step, Ezekiel Elliott is RB5 for The Last Dance (3-5). Trey Sermon (RB56) seems like he is coming into his own and may benefit from playing with Trey Lance. The Eagles don‚Äôt seem to like Miles Sanders (RB33) very much despite his rushing/receiving dual skillset.</p>

<p>Team Double Dipp (6-2) punted the running back position in the draft, and it is somehow working out successfully. Ronald Jones (RB64) and Kenyan Drake (RB46) have done next to nothing, but Kareem Hunt (RB6) appears to be the goal line back for the Browns. Zach vs. the World‚Äôs Nick Chubb (RB12) could be so much more without the annoying presence of Hunt stealing away touchdowns.</p>

<p>Najee Harris (RB8) and Darrell Henderson (RB25) are both rostered by Mahomes Sweet Home (6-2), another team which went light on backs in the draft. It has been profitable to this point, but only time will tell if depth will hold up.</p>

<p>Joe (4-4) has been hampered by RB injuries to this point in the season--David Montgomery (RB11) and Christian McCaffrey (RB16), his first and third round picks are out. Luckily, both should be back relatively soon as neither injury is season-ending.</p>

<p>Saquon Barkley (RB13) is back! After a slow September he has really turned it on and could be the league winner for Diggs in a Blanket (3-5). DIAB (2nd in fantasy points) has hit a tough schedule including Week 2 in which he lost both matchups despite scoring 140.9 fantasy points. Let‚Äôs see if Jonathan Taylor‚Äôs (RB20) nice Week 4 can get him back in the RB1 conversation for the rest of the season.</p>

<p>You know things are messed up in the United States of Kamarica (5-3) when Alvin Kamara (RB 14) didn‚Äôt get a single target from Jameis Winston in Week 4. New trade addition Chris Carson (RB24) could be out or hindered for a while with a neck injury.</p>

<p>Dalvin Cook (RB29) is clearly not his typical self for Derek (4-4) as he tries to play through an ankle injury. Clyde Edward-Helaire (RB22) has strung together back-to-back 100-yard rushing weeks.</p>

<p>Da Adams Family (1-7) clearly made a deal with the devil and is now paying the price with some of the worst running back injury luck ever. Raheem Mostert is out for the season, Josh Jacobs missed multiple games, and now Antonio Gibson (RB17) is playing through a stress fracture. And that‚Äôs not to mention injuries to Elijah Mitchell and Rashaad Penny.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other interesting running back situations to monitor, but I‚Äôm going to put a cap on this piece for now. Fantasy football and running backs are an ever-changing landscape so now is not the time to sit on your laurels if things are going well or pout if you‚Äôve struggled. Get ready to be surprised, enjoy the football in Week 5, and good luck!</p>
